                        <p class="vaporwave-color-1 answer-text">In this assignment, I explored the portrayal of artificial intelligence in the film "Finch." The movie presents a post-apocalyptic scenario where AI plays a crucial role in the characters' lives. I examined two distinct AI characters in the film: a basic AI rover, Dewey, and a more advanced AI, Jeff, designed to care for the protagonist's dog. My analysis focused on how the film depicts AI's evolution from a mere tool to a self-aware entity capable of compassion and displaying human emotions. I dug into the ethical implications of AI's treatment and its potential to become more than just a machine, emphasizing the need for humanity to approach AI with respect and nurturing.

This policy outlines detailed guidelines for distinguishing between AI-assisted and original student work, emphasizing the importance of transparency and proper citation. It covers using AI for creating content like homework, essays, and reports. The policy also stipulates the necessity of explicitly citing all uses of generative AI, detailing the consequences of failure to adhere to these guidelines, including disciplinary actions in line with the University's academic integrity code.

                        <p class="vaporwave-color-1 answer-text">The project aimed to establish a clear, ethical framework for using generative AI in academic settings. The primary goal was to protect academic integrity within the class by providing clear and precise guidelines on AI usage. I designed the policy to help students understand the difference between leveraging AI as a tool and relying on it to the point of compromising their original work. It also aimed to foster a sense of responsibility and awareness among students regarding the implications of using AI in their academic work.
