This task deepened my understanding of the subject, sharpened my problem-solving skills, and challenged my critical thinking and analytical abilities. It also aligned with the course's Rhetorical Awareness and Critical Thinking goals, as I considered multiple perspectives to propose well-reasoned solutions. As stated in my analysis, “The professor must decide between upholding the class rules and the fabric of academic integrity regardless of the student’s intent... or using the situation to help their students understand the importance of performing due diligence on the tools they use by checking to see if they use AI” <a href="artifacts.html#case_study_analysis" class="vaporwave-accent-5" target="_blank">(Zeller, 2023, p. 3.)</a>. The skills I gained in analyzing information and offering solutions can be applied to future ethical and analytical writing tasks, enhancing my ability to handle complex real-world situations.

This activity aligned with the reflection goal of the course, enabling me to critically evaluate my work and learning process. The project involved drafting a policy to “protect academic integrity within the University of Arizona by providing detailed guidelines on the ethical and responsible use of generative AI in the Fall 2023 ENGL 101-426 class” <a href="artifacts.html#case_study_analysis" class="vaporwave-accent-5" target="_blank">(Zeller, 2023, p. 1)</a>. It underscored the importance of distinguishing between AI-assisted and original work, emphasizing transparency and proper citation. This reflective process helped me assess how my values and circumstances informed my writing choices and highlighted the need to adhere to academic integrity. Additionally, it allowed me to apply these insights to future writing projects, fostering a deeper understanding of my writing journey and its broader implications in academic contexts.

This task required integrating various media formats, aligning with understanding genre conventions, enhancing my narrative skills, and considering audience engagement. As I narrated, “My journey through academia has been shadowed by a constant feeling that I was a charlatan undeserving of the accolades and achievements I've earned” <a href="artifacts.html#case_study_analysis" class="vaporwave-accent-5" target="_blank">(Zeller, 2023, Beyond Doubt [Video].

It allowed me to reflect on the emotional aspects of my academic journey, fostering a deeper understanding of literacy’s impact on individual perceptions. Furthermore, the skills I gained in digital storytelling and literacy reflection through this project can be applied to future academic and personal endeavors, contributing to my ongoing learning journey.

This exercise in meaningful reflection aligned with goal five in our course and prompted deep thought about my writing and thinking process. In my reflection, I mentioned, "Through my narrative, I intended to share my struggle with imposter syndrome...

This process aligned with the course's critical thinking and composing goals, as it required me to use critical thinking to understand the ethical dilemmas and existential questions presented in the film. In my analysis, I noted, "In the film 'Finch,' AI is initially represented as a tool to assist its creator. Nonetheless, as the movie advances, it becomes clear that the AI Jeff is more than a machine, becoming a companion to Finch and his dog" <a href="artifacts.html#ai_in_fiction" class="vaporwave-accent-5" target="_blank">(Zeller, 2023, p. 2)</a>. Exploring AI's evolving role from a mere tool to a sentient capable of emotion and self-awareness enhanced my understanding of AI ethics and its real-life implications. The project promoted a deeper reflection of complex issues like AI that I can apply to future discussions and writings on technology and ethics.
