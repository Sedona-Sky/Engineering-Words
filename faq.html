As you explore cases, like a student inadvertently using AI, you'll enhance your problem-solving and critical-thinking abilities. This process aligns with the course's Rhetorical Awareness and Critical Thinking goals. For instance, you might examine scenarios where a <span class="vaporwave-accent-5">"professor must decide between upholding the class rules and the fabric of academic integrity regardless of the student's intent... or using the situation to help their students understand the importance of performing due diligence on the tools they use by checking to see if they use AI"</span> <a href="artifacts.html#case_study_analysis" class="vaporwave-accent-5" data-bs-toggle="show" target="_blank">(Zeller, 2023, p. 3.).</a> My analysis presents the real-world relevance of ethical decision-making in academic settings, emphasizing the importance of balancing rule enforcement with educational opportunities. Finally, this experience will challenge you and prepare you to apply these critical analytical skills to real-world situations in your future writing tasks.

This assignment required us to apply specific writing conventions for crafting clear, effective policy documents. For instance, as outlined in the policy I created, <span class="vaporwave-accent-5">"Students must explicitly cite all uses of generative AI"</span> <a href="artifacts.html#ai_policy" class="vaporwave-accent-5" target="_blank">(Zeller, 2023, p. 2).</a> In writing this, I focused on balancing clarity and respectfulness, reflecting my growing understanding of rhetorical awareness.

This approach not only enhanced my skills in critical analysis and addressing complex topics, but it also serves as a model for you, the reader, demonstrating how such tasks can deepen your understanding of writing conventions and rhetorical awareness in your works.

In assignments like the <a href="artifacts.html#ai_policy_reflection" class="vaporwave-accent-5" target="_blank">AI Policy Reflection</a>, you'll discover the importance of balancing diverse perspectives and ethical considerations. Reflecting on my writing, I realized it <span class="vaporwave-accent-5">"helped me grow as a critical thinker, practicing objectively looking at opposing views with little to no bias"</span> <a href="artifacts.html#ai_policy_reflection" class="vaporwave-accent-5" target="_blank"></a>(Zeller, 2023, p. 3).</a> For example, when drafting the policy, I had to consider various perspectives on AI use in academia, ranging from very strict to more permissive, synthesizing these perspectives to form an unbiased policy. This process of reflecting and synthesizing diverse viewpoints, as you'll experience in your writing journey, not only deepens your understanding of complex and ethical writing but also illustrates the essence of good writing in English 101 – the ability to articulate informed, balanced, and unbiased perspectives shaped by thorough research and reflection.

The video will incorporate multimedia elements like audio, images, transitions, and animated graphics. This multimedia format is pivotal in enhancing storytelling skills and audience engagement. In my video "Beyond Doubt," I focused on overcoming imposter syndrome. For instance, I detailed, <span class="vaporwave-accent-5">"My experiences at the school's science and engineering fair exemplified these feelings.
