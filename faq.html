As you explore cases, like a student inadvertently using AI, you'll enhance your problem-solving and critical-thinking abilities. This process aligns with the course's Rhetorical Awareness and Critical Thinking goals. For instance, you might examine scenarios where a professor must choose between upholding academic integrity or using the situation as a learning opportunity about AI tools' due diligence, as I highlighted in my analysis: <span class="vaporwave-accent-6">"The professor must decide between upholding the class rules and the fabric of academic integrity regardless of the student's intent... or using the situation to help their students understand the importance of performing due diligence on the tools they use by checking to see if they use AI"</span> <a href="artifacts.html#case_study_analysis" class="vaporwave-accent-5" data-bs-toggle="show" target="_blank">(Zeller, 2023, p. 3.)</a>. This experience will challenge you and prepare you to apply these critical analytical skills to real-world situations in your future writing tasks.

In my experience, this reflection process allows you to revisit and reevaluate your initial analysis, providing a deeper understanding of the complexities involved. As I noted, "analyzing the case study from multiple perspectives... I realize there is no 'one size fits all' solution" <a href="artifacts.html#case_study_analysis_reflection" class="vaporwave-accent-5" data-bs-toggle="show" target="_blank">(Zeller, 2023, p. 2)</a>. This kind of introspection helps you understand the multifaceted nature of ethical dilemmas, particularly in the context of AI and education, enhancing your ability to articulate well-reasoned arguments and solutions in your writing. Such reflective practices are crucial for honing your ability to compose thoughtfully and engage with complex topics critically, aligning with the goals of English 101​​.

This analysis assignment required revisiting and reinterpreting our understanding of AI, pushing us to revise our initial perceptions. In Finch, we see a transition in the role of AI from a tool to a sentient companion, which necessitates a revised view of AI's ethical treatment. As I observed in my analysis, "Finch becomes frustrated with Jeff... lashing out at him and saying he is just a machine... [but] Finch later realizes his error" <a href="artifacts.html#ai_in_fiction" class="vaporwave-accent-5" target="_blank">(Zeller, 2023, p. 3)</a>. This narrative arc illustrates the process of Revision, not just in writing but in our cognitive approach to complex subjects like AI. Analyzing such themes in fiction helps you develop the ability to think critically about evolving concepts, revise your viewpoints, and apply these skills to your writing and broader academic work.

Through assignments like the <a href="artifacts.html#ai_policy_reflection" class="vaporwave-accent-5" target="_blank">AI Policy Reflection</a> assignment, you'll gain insights into your writing journey, discovering the importance of balancing diverse perspectives and ethical considerations. As I experienced, reflecting on the process "helped me grow as a critical thinker, practicing objectively looking at opposing views with little to no bias" <a href="artifacts.html#ai_policy_reflection" class="vaporwave-accent-5" target="_blank">(Zeller, 2023, p. 3)</a>. You'll learn to appreciate the research phase, understand different aspects of writing, such as policy drafting, and grapple with the nuances of complex issues, like AI ethics. Moreover, this reflective approach will enhance your understanding of the complexities of writing and the ethical implications of your work, fostering a deeper comprehension of how your values and circumstances influence your writing choices​.

This endeavor challenges you to integrate various media formats, enhancing your storytelling skills and audience engagement. For instance, in my project, I shared how "My experiences at the school's science and engineering fair exemplified these feelings. Reluctantly I participated and invested myself in a project about bioluminescent organisms" <a href="artifacts.html#beyond_doubt" class="vaporwave-accent-5" target="_blank">(Zeller, 2023, Beyond Doubt [Video].

This reflection, integral to our course, aims to deepen your understanding of your writing and thinking processes. In my reflection, I uncovered the importance of being open and honest in my narrative, as shown by my realization that "A major lesson I learned during this exercise was the power of vulnerability in storytelling" <a href="artifacts.html#digital_literacy_narrative_reflection" class="vaporwave-accent-5" target="_blank">(Zeller, 2023, p. 2)</a>. This insight emerged from sharing my personal experiences, where I found that embracing vulnerability made my narrative more relatable and impactful. Additionally, the assignment will teach you the value of conciseness in your script, which "helped me understand the importance of focusing on critical points in storytelling" <a href="artifacts.html#digital_literacy_narrative_reflection" class="vaporwave-accent-5" target="_blank">(Zeller, 2023, p. 2)</a>, emphasizing the need to refine your narrative to its most essential elements. Finally, creating a digital narrative will also enhance your ability to effectively communicate complex and personal topics, improving your writing skills, emotional expression, and storytelling ability.
