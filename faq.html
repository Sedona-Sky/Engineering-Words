This task deepened my understanding of the subject, sharpened my problem-solving skills, and challenged my critical thinking and analytical abilities. It also aligned with the course's Rhetorical Awareness and Critical Thinking goals, as I considered multiple perspectives to propose well-reasoned solutions. As stated in my analysis, “The professor must decide between upholding the class rules and the fabric of academic integrity regardless of the student’s intent... or using the situation to help their students understand the importance of performing due diligence on the tools they use by checking to see if they use AI” <a href="artifacts.html#case_study_analysis" class="vaporwave-accent-5" target="_blank">(Zeller, 2023, p. 3.)</a>.

It related to Rhetorical Awareness, encouraging critical analysis of my personal literacy experiences. Additionally, this assignment required significant revision. I had to reduce my initial script from over sixteen hundred to four hundred and ninety-two words to ensure my message fit within the prescribed three-to-five-minute time limit without losing meaning. Furthermore, the scriptwriting and narrative construction skills I developed during this project can be applied to future storytelling projects, enhancing my narrative crafting abilities and use of multimedia to connect with my audience and make my message more engaging.
